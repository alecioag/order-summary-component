## My process

I started by taking a look at the design, then I built the html, after that I added css. I designed the desktop version. I did not add any media queries because I have not learned about them yet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've been praticing flexbox lately, which was the last thing I learned. This project helped me center the -change- button, I tried some things and they just did not work out, then I tried flexbox box and boom, it worked quite well. I think there is a better way to do that though.

### Continued development

I'm focusing on really learning flexbox before moving on to grid or media queries.
